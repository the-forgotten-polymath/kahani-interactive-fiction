# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

## Types

Keep types in **one place per layer**. Do not define duplicate shapes inline in components or route files.

| Module | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| [`lib/types/client.ts`](lib/types/client.ts) | React components, client pages, fetch response/request shapes consumed by the browser |
| [`lib/types/server.ts`](lib/types/server.ts) | API route handlers, `lib/games.ts`, DB row shapes, server-only request bodies |
| [`lib/types/shared.ts`](lib/types/shared.ts) | Cross-layer domain types with no Node/browser APIs (e.g. `Premise`) |
| [`lib/universe.ts`](lib/universe.ts) | Explorable-world generation types (`GameBible`, `SceneData`, dialogue) |

- Import client types in components with `@/lib/types/client`.
- Import server types in routes and server libs with `@/lib/types/server`.
- [`lib/types.ts`](lib/types.ts) re-exports client types for backward compatibility — prefer the explicit paths in new code.

## Helpers

- [`lib/constants.ts`](lib/constants.ts) is for **shared constants only** — no functions.
- Do not add new `lib/*.ts` files for one-off utilities.
- Inline logic at the call site when it runs in one place; colocate in an existing domain module (e.g. [`lib/games.ts`](lib/games.ts)) only when reused across multiple routes.

## Server-side retries

Wrap transient-prone outbound calls with the shared retry helper in [`lib/retry.ts`](lib/retry.ts):

- Use `withRetry(fn, DEFAULT_RETRY_OPTS)` for Supabase Storage uploads, external `fetch` calls, and other server I/O that can fail on rate limits, 5xx, or network blips.
- For Gemini `generateContent`, use [`generateContentWithRetry`](lib/gemini.ts) — do not call `ai().models.generateContent` directly in new code.
- Keep retry logic in domain libs (`lib/gemini.ts`, `lib/world-engine.ts`, `lib/games.ts`), not in API route handlers.
- Defaults live in [`lib/constants.ts`](lib/constants.ts): `RETRY_MAX` (3) and `RETRY_BASE_MS` (500).

## Documentation

- Add **JSDoc** (`/** … */`) on exported functions, types, components, and API route handlers.
- Add brief **inline comments** for non-obvious logic (quota gates, persistence, generation vs replay paths).
- Prefer comments that explain *why* (e.g. "non-owners cannot generate — edge becomes a wall") over restating the code.

## API routes (persistence)

New game persistence routes follow REST conventions:

- `GET/POST /api/games`, `GET/DELETE /api/games/[id]`
- `PUT /api/games/[id]/scenes/[sceneId]`, `PUT …/sprite`, `PUT …/finales/[outcome]`
- `GET /api/profile` — generation quota lives on the user resource, not the games collection

Use correct status codes: `200`, `201`, `204`, `401`, `403`, `404`, `422`.

## Supabase

Run [`supabase/migrations/0001_games.sql`](supabase/migrations/0001_games.sql) once for game persistence. Set `profiles.is_unlimited = true` for admin accounts that bypass `FREE_GAME_LIMIT`.

## Dev sign-in

When running `pnpm dev`, the login page shows an **email + password** form (gated by `NODE_ENV === "development"` — absent from production builds). Use it to authenticate before testing game flows.

**Cursor cloud secrets** (you configure these; the app does not read them):

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `KAHANI_DEV_EMAIL` | Dev test account email |
| `KAHANI_DEV_PASSWORD` | Dev test account password |

**Agent workflow:**

1. Ensure the dev server is running (`pnpm dev`).
2. Read `KAHANI_DEV_EMAIL` and `KAHANI_DEV_PASSWORD` from the environment.
3. Navigate to `/login`.
4. Fill the **Development only** email + password form and submit.
5. You land on `/` with a session and can create or play worlds.

These vars are for agent use only — never add them to production Vercel env or wire them into app code.

**One-time human setup** (dev Supabase project):

- Enable email + password under Authentication → Providers → Email.
- Create the test user (matching the secrets above) in the Supabase dashboard.
- Optionally grant unlimited generation: `update public.profiles set is_unlimited = true where id = '<user-uuid>';`
